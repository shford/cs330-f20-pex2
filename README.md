Welcome to USAFA's very own CS 330 PEX 2 - Boid Project.

I had the pleasure of writing this project. I'd like to thank Dr. Hadfield and some guy who had his dog in squad for the support and morale boost!

Documentation for the new classes in this PEX may found at the top of FlockingSimulation.java.
Documentation for the old Vector333 classes may be found at the top of Vector333Class.java.
